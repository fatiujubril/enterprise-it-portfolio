# Enterprise IT & Cybersecurity Portfolio — Fatiu Jubril

Hands-on enterprise projects focused on **identity security, incident response, and Microsoft 365 environments**.

This portfolio demonstrates real-world experience investigating security incidents, identifying misconfigurations, and operating secure, cloud-first Microsoft ecosystems.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of **security operations** and **enterprise IT**, with a strong focus on identity, access control, and Microsoft-based platforms.

My experience includes:
- Identity & Access Management (Microsoft Entra ID)
- Conditional Access & MFA enforcement
- Microsoft 365 security incidents
- Sign-in log analysis and threat detection
- Incident response, remediation, and recovery
- Secure enterprise IT operations and governance

This work reflects responsibilities commonly found in **SOC, IAM, Security Engineering, and Cloud Operations roles**.

## Featured Cybersecurity Projects

### 🔐 Project 02 — Conditional Access Failure & Identity Attack Simulation
**Focus:** Identity misconfiguration, MFA bypass detection, incident response

A realistic identity security scenario demonstrating how a **Conditional Access exclusion** can silently disable MFA enforcement for a high-value executive account — without malware, phishing, or external attackers.

Key outcomes:
- Built a secure Conditional Access baseline
- Introduced a controlled misconfiguration (MFA exclusion)
- Detected MFA bypass via Entra ID sign-in telemetry
- Performed containment, remediation, and recovery
- Documented governance improvements to prevent recurrence

### 📧 Project 01 — Microsoft 365 Phishing Incident Response
**Focus:** Account compromise investigation, mailbox abuse, remediation

A Microsoft 365 phishing incident simulation focused on **identity abuse and mailbox persistence**, following a structured SOC-style incident response workflow.

Key outcomes:
- Investigated phishing-based credential compromise
- Identified malicious mailbox rules used for persistence
- Analyzed outbound phishing activity via message trace
- Contained the incident and hardened the account
- Produced clear, evidence-backed incident documentation

## Systems & IT Engineering (Security-Aligned)

In addition to security-focused projects, this portfolio will include **enterprise IT engineering work** that directly supports secure operations.

These projects emphasize **how systems decisions impact security**, including:
- Microsoft 365 tenant configuration and governance
- Identity lifecycle management (joiner / mover / leaver)
- Administrative access controls and role separation
- Secure baseline configuration for users and services
- Operational decisions that reduce identity and security risk

This section is intentionally aligned with security outcomes and reflects real-world responsibilities in **IT Operations, Systems Engineering, and Hybrid IT/Security roles**.

➡️ Systems & IT Engineering projects are currently in progress and will be added here.
