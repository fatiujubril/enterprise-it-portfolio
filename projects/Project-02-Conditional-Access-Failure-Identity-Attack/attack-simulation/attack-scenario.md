# Attack Scenario – Conditional Access Exception Abuse

This section documents the simulated attack scenario used in Project 2.  
The objective is to demonstrate how a **legitimate administrative decision** can unintentionally weaken identity security controls and create a high-risk authentication bypass.

This scenario does **not** involve phishing, malware, or external threat actors.  
Instead, it focuses on **internal misconfiguration and exception handling failure** at the identity layer.

## Scenario Overview

The organization enforces multifactor authentication (MFA) using Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access. MFA is required for all interactive user sign-ins as part of the baseline security posture.

During normal operations, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) experienced an authentication disruption due to a change in their mobile device used for Microsoft Authenticator. As a result, MFA prompts could not be completed successfully, preventing access to business-critical Microsoft 365 services.

To restore access quickly, IT administrators temporarily excluded the CEO account from the Conditional Access policy enforcing MFA.

The exclusion was intended to be **temporary**, but no expiration, tracking, or follow-up review was implemented.

---

## Attack Condition Introduced

The following conditions were introduced during the scenario:

- The Conditional Access policy enforcing MFA remained enabled
- All standard users continued to be protected by MFA
- The CEO account was explicitly excluded from the policy
- The exclusion caused Conditional Access to evaluate as **Not Applied** for the CEO
- The CEO was able to authenticate using **single-factor authentication**

At this point, the environment entered a **high-risk identity state**, despite appearing secure at a policy level.

---

## Why This Represents an Attack Path

Although no malicious activity was involved, the resulting condition is functionally equivalent to an identity attack:

- A high-value account could authenticate without MFA
- Authentication logs showed successful sign-ins with downgraded security requirements
- No alerts or warnings were generated by default
- The exposure persisted until manually detected

This demonstrates how **policy exceptions can silently override security intent**, creating an attack surface without any external compromise.

---

## Threat Classification

This scenario is classified as:

- **Attack Type:** Internal policy exception abuse
- **Attack Vector:** Conditional Access exclusion
- **Root Cause:** Inadequate exception governance
- **Threat Actor:** Non-malicious internal action
- **Impact:** Single-factor authentication exposure on a high-value identity

---

## Transition to Detection Phase

The attack scenario concludes once the Conditional Access exclusion is in place and the CEO account begins authenticating without MFA enforcement.

Subsequent sections document how this condition was identified through sign-in telemetry and policy analysis, followed by containment, remediation, and recovery actions.
