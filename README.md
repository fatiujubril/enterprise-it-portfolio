# Enterprise IT & Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hands-on portfolio demonstrating **Cybersecurity**, **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**, and **Enterprise IT Operations** in Microsoft-centric environments.

Built around **real-world failure scenarios**: how security and IT controls break, how issues are detected, and how they are remediated and governed long-term.

> **Includes an in-progress Privileged Access & Vulnerability Risk Program (Cloud + SIEM + IaC)** focused on reducing administrative risk and improving detection visibility.

---

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Practical **security engineering & SecOps** thinking  
- **Identity-first security** (Entra ID, Conditional Access, MFA, governance)  
- **Incident response & investigation** using logs and telemetry  
- **Enterprise IT operations** with a security-first mindset  
- Clear, repeatable **documentation and decision-making**

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Projects

### **Project 01 – Microsoft 365 Phishing Incident Response**
Simulated phishing incident covering detection, investigation, containment, and post-incident hardening in a Microsoft 365 environment.

**Demonstrates:**  
Incident response · Email security · Account compromise handling · Operational hygiene

### **Project 02 – Conditional Access Failure & Identity Attack Simulation**
Identity attack scenario showing how a **Conditional Access misconfiguration** can bypass MFA for a high-value account—without malware or phishing.

**Demonstrates:**  
Entra ID · Conditional Access · MFA validation · Identity governance · Telemetry-driven investigation

### **Project 03 – Privileged Access + Vulnerability Risk Program** *(In Progress)*
Security engineering program focused on **privileged access risk**, **vulnerability exposure**, and **SIEM visibility**, designed with an **IaC and governance-first mindset**.

**Focus areas:**  
Privileged identity · Risk prioritization · SIEM detections · Secure-by-default baselines

📌 Status: In progress

## 🛠️ Systems & IT Engineering *(In Progress)*

Upcoming projects covering:
- Microsoft 365 & Entra ID administration  
- Identity lifecycle (Joiner / Mover / Leaver)  
- Windows Server, AD, and endpoint management  
- Automation with PowerShell  
- Backup, recovery, and operational governance

## Resume & Applications

I maintain **role-specific, tailored PDF resumes** (Cybersecurity, IAM, Systems).  
A single static resume is intentionally not linked.

Happy to share the appropriate version during an application or interview.

---

## How to Review (Optional)

- Skim a project README for **scenario → findings → remediation**
- Review screenshots/logs if you want deeper technical detail  
Each project is understandable end-to-end without prior context.

## Contact / Next Steps

This portfolio is actively maintained and expanded.

I’m happy to:
- Walk through any project
- Explain trade-offs and design decisions
- Discuss how these scenarios map to production environments
